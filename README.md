* Tool organization to mimic the position of Adobe Photoshop;
* New Splash Screen
* New default settings to maximize space on the canvas;
* Shortcuts similar to the ones in Photoshop for Windows, following Adobeâ€™s Documentation;
* New icon and Name from custom .desktop file.

## âš™ How to Install (using Flatpak)

This package is all about flatpak, but it also contains "just files" that you can use on any version of GIMP (.deb, .rpm, Snap, AppImage, Windows, macOS). Just check the location of the GIMP configuration files.

**Start and quit GIMP after you installed before you continue!**
